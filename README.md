Description: fif (find in files) is a portable, lightweight desktop application that allows you to search multiple text files in a directory for a word or sentence. It also works for filetypes such as .h, .md, .css and whatnot. This is a mirror of the original sourceforge repository at https://sourceforge.net/projects/fif/, made by https://github.com/hippy2094.

Note: Only ASCI or UTF-8 are supported. UTF-16, for instance, won't work.

I've also included the .dmg, which was only made for the initial version (0.2). While it states that it is a Qt application, it seems like the author switched to something else after 0.2.1, as there are no Qt files to be found after that. He also did not provide any build instructions. It works for Windows 7, 8, 10 and most likely 11 as well.
