fif is a small utility that searches files for matching search phrases.

Features include:

  * Portable
  * Easy to use UI
  * Recursive search
  * Specify multiple file extensions
  * Cross platform

Simply extract the archive and run!

File extensions are standard masks (eg *.txt) and you can seperate multiple 
extensions with a semi-colon: *.html;*.php;*.js
